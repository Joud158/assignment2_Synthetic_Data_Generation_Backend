## 1) Why synthetic data is useful
Synthetic data enables fast and low-cost generation of large datasets with perfect ground-truth labels especially when real data collection or annotation is difficult. For example, datasets of volcanos.

## 2) Advantages vs real data
- Automatic labels 
- Easy to scale and customize
- Can cover rare/edge-case scenarios or dangerous ones

## 3) Limitations of my renderer
- 2D not true 3D
- No realistic lighting, materials, textures, or shadows
- Approximate depth
- May not generalize to real-world scenarios

## 4) How Isaac Sim improves this pipeline
- True 3D
- Can add lighting/materials/textures
- Physics-based placement and interactions
